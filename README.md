## To-do
- Views (high priority)
- Content warnings (high priority)
- OAuth web login (medium priority)
- Image display somehow. Maybe make new GameObjects and download the images somewhere since Computer Interface doesn't have image support? Gonna be really painful and hacky but I think it'd work (medium priority)
- Clean up code and remove comments from Computer Interface examples
## Done
- Log-in with token
- Configuration file
